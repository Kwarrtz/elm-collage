{-| With this module, you can compose collages in a more automatic way.
Instead of shifting collages manually,
this module figures out the dimensions of each part of your drawing
and places them seamlessly next to each other, above each other or on top of each other.
This is all possible by keeping track of the _envelope_ or _bounding box_ of each collage.

Collages are positioned relative to their _internal origin_.
By default, a collage's internal origin lays in its exact center.
By _shifting_ a collage, we change its internal origin
and the way it composes with other collages.
Another method to change the origin is by using _alignments_.

All these ideas are based on the [Diagrams library](https://archives.haskell.org/projects.haskell.org/diagrams/) for Haskell
and the [Scalable Graphics library](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2746329) for Clean.
You can regard this module as a simplified version of above libraries.


# Envelopes

An _envelope_ defines the bounding box of a collage.
It is sometimes referred to as a _span box_.
[Envelopes](https://archives.haskell.org/projects.haskell.org/diagrams/doc/manual.html#envelopes-and-local-vector-spaces)
can become quite complex when we calculate them in all possible directions.
Here, we restrict ourselves to four directions: up, down, right and left.

@docs envelope, Direction, opposite, width, height


# Layouting

Collages can be composed in three ways:

  - horizontally, or next to each other
  - vertically, or above each other
  - on the "out of page" axis, or stacked on top of each other

A more advanced way of combining collages is by _imposition_:
placing one collage on top of a background and forgetting about the dimensions of the foreground.
All ways of combining are expressed used one basic placing function,
which you can use in some extreme cases where you need to place a collage but not combine it with others.

@docs horizontal, vertical, stack, impose, beside, place


# Spacers

What is placing collages without being able to space them accordingly?
These two collages are invisible and only take up some space.
(Or they even don't...)

@docs spacer, empty


# Aligning

@docs align, at, center


## Anchors

@docs Anchor, top, topRight, right, bottomRight, bottom, bottomLeft, left, topLeft, base


# Debugging

These two functions can aid in discovering how collages are composed.

@docs showOrigin, showEnvelope


# Possible extensions

We can imagine some possible extensions which could aid in designing composable drawings:

  - way to add padding
  - add `baseX`, and `baseY` (`horizontalBase` and `vertialBase`)?
  - and add `centerX`, and `centerY` too?
  - ...

{-| Calculate the envelope of a collage relative to its internal origin.

The figure below illustrates the four distances that can be calculated.
We represent the origin with `(X)`.
When calling, for example, `envelope Up`,
we calculate the distance from `(X)` to the upper edge of the rectangle.

Use this to position a collage next to another collage without actually composing them.

{-| Place a collage _beside_ another one in the given direction and combine them into a new one.

Most of the time it is way nicer to use `horizontal` or `vertical` to express your layout,
but `beside dir` can come into hand as a curried function.

The new origin will be the origin of the first argument.

  - Note: `beside dir` forms a monoid with `empty` for every `dir`.
  - Note: same as `beside` in Diagrams.

vertical =
    List.foldr (beside Down) empty


{-| Place a list of collages on top of each other, with their origin points stacked on the "out of page" axis.

The first collage in the list is on top.
This actually is the same as the `group` operation in the Collage module.

    stack [a, b, c]

        +–––+
        |(a)|
        +–––+

(Yes, `b` and `c` are somewhere below `a`...)

  - Note: when we create an operator `(<>)` like

        (<>) a b =
            stack [ a, b ]

    then `(<>)` forms a monoid together with `empty`.
    `(<>)` is called `atop` in Diagrams.

{-| Impose a collage on a background.

The call

    impose fore back

stacks `fore` on `back`.

-- Alignment -------------------------------------------------------------------


{-| Shift a collage such that the origin is on the given anchor.

Use this, for example, when you like to align some collages to the top:

    [a, b, c]
        |> List.map (align top)
        |> horizontal

        +–(X)–+––––X––––+–X–+

        +–––––+         |   |
                        +–––+

Anchors are created by the functions from the section below.

-}
align : Anchor msg -> Collage msg -> Collage msg
align anchor collage =
    shift (anchor collage) collage


{-| Stack a collage on top of a specified anchor of a host.

Makes placing objects on a collage a lot easier:

    drawing
        |> at bottom dot
        |> at upperRight dot

        +–––––––––0
        | drawing |
        +––––0––––+

instead of:

    stack
        [ dot
        , align upperRight <| stack
            [ dot
            , align bottom drawing
            ]
        ]

This does not change the origin of `collage`.

-}
at : Anchor msg -> Collage msg -> Collage msg -> Collage msg
at anchor collage host =
    stack [ collage, align anchor host ]


{-| Shift a collage such that the envelope in all directions is equal.

This is the same as aligning on the base anchor:
